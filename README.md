## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Namal Mess Management System** is a robust, modular solution designed to streamline mess-related operations in an academic environment. The system enables students and faculty (users) to:

- Browse digital menus
- Place and manage food orders
- Monitor order statuses
- Recharge and manage digital wallets
- View order history

Simultaneously, administrative roles, such as mess managers, and kitchen staff, can:

- Register users
- Generate reports
- Manage transactions
- Send notifications
- Manage food items and pricing

The system’s architecture promotes **efficiency**, **transparency**, and **user satisfaction**, replacing traditional manual processes with automated, intuitive interactions.
